# A-Diphone-Based-Maltese-Speech-Synthesis-System
This project was submitted as my Final Year Project for the University of Malta Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (Honours) (Artificial Intelligence) Degree. It is an implementation of a Text-to-Speech synthesis system for Maltese.

Dissertation.pdf is a soft copy of the submitted spiral-bound dissertation.

The MalteseTTS folder contains all the source code, tools and diphone databases needed to run the developed TTS system.
In order to install the dependencies required to execute the scripts, Anaconda 3.7 can be downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
After it is installed, a new environment can be created using the 'Import' button, and choosing the included 'MalteseTTS.yml'
as a Specification File, which will install all the necessary Python packages.
MalteseTTS.py or MalteseTTSuskal.py can then be executed from within the aforementioned environment to synthesise speech.
